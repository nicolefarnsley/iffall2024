<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<p style="max-width: 70%;">
    <t class = text>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Set out a 9 by 9 in square baking pan and a sheet pan.
In a large bowl, make your filling. Combine berries, sugar, orange juice, cornstarch, and salt.
Stir to coat the berries well.
Pour berry mixture into your square baking dish.
In the same bowl (hooray! save dishes!), make the crisp topping. Combine softened butter, brown sugar, oats, flour, vanilla, and salt.
Use a fork, pastry blender, or your hands to combine the mixture until clumps and clusters form and there are no dry spots remaining in the crisp mixture.
Sprinkle the crisp mixture over the berries in the baking dish.
Place your baking dish on a sheet pan (in case of spills)
Bake your berry crisp at 350 degrees for 40-50 minutes, or until the crisp is golden and the filling is bubbling. (If the crisp starts browning too fast, cover loosely with foil)
Allow the crisp to cool at least 20-30 minutes before serving. (Be sure to wait, as this will help the filling set.)</i></p>
