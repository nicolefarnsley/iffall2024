<p> 1. Nicole Farnsley, Junior in Communication Design</p>

<p> 2. Being a Comm Des major, this is a required class for me, but I have also wanted to learn basic HTML and CSS since it's helpful to know as a designer.</p>

<p> 3. I don't have any experience with HTML and CSS.</p>

<p> 4. I'd like to feel comfortable with basic coding/website functions, and be able to use that in design/creating websites. </p>

<p> 5. I think designing for screen can require more attention to detail, since a typo or mistake i code can keep it from doing what you'd like it to.</p>

<p> 6. <a href="https://ourspecialsupport.com/">Our Special Support</a> The imagery in this site contrasts well with the blck background and type, creating strong and compelling design.</p>

<p> 7. <a href="https://hannahkansy.de/">Hannah Kansey</a> This site is simple and straightforward, elevating the designers work with contact info easy to see at the top.</p>

<p> 8. <a href="https://actualobjects.net/">Actual Objects</a> The design of this site is super maximalist and overwhelming, which aligns with this creator's work and client base. The massive index of work on display also showcases their success and respect within the music industry.</p>
